Teach Me To Write
====

A simple web application that uses handwriting recognition to teach people to write.

Supported features
---
At the moment only numbers and upper case letters are supported. But I believe my code is a bit hacky and the character generator is providing symbols from time to time as well so.... have fun!

To run
---
I'm sure you have Python installed so just run...

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000
